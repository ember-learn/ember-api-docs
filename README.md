# [Ember API Docs](https://api.emberjs.com/) [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/ember-learn/ember-api-docs.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/ember-learn/ember-api-docs)

This project contains only the [API docs](https://api.emberjs.com/) portion of [Emberjs.com](https://emberjs.com/). If you're looking for the rest of the site,
see the [website](https://github.com/emberjs/website)
and [guides](https://github.com/emberjs/guides) repositories.

There are many pieces that together create the Ember API docs site:
- The app in this repository, which fetches and displays the API docs data. It is what you see at
[https://api.emberjs.com/](https://api.emberjs.com/)
- The YUIdoc code comments found in the
[Ember.js codebase](https://github.com/emberjs/ember.js), where the informational content of the API documentation can be edited
- The data generator that serializes code comments into JSONAPI and
deploys the result,
[ember-jsonapi-docs](https://github.com/ember-learn/ember-jsonapi-docs)
- [ember-styleguide](https://github.com/ember-learn/ember-styleguide),
a component and styling library shared across apps.
- [algolia-index-update-scripts](https://github.com/ember-learn/algolia-index-update-scripts) for managing the search feature of the api docs site
