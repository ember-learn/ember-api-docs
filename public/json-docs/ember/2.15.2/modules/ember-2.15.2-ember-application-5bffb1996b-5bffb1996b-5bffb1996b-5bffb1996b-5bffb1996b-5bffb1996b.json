For example, between test runs and FastBoot\nrequests, the application stays the same. It is only the state that we want\nto reset.</p>\n<p>That state is what the <code>ApplicationInstance</code> manages: it is responsible for\ncreating the container that contains all application state, and disposing of\nit once the particular test run or FastBoot request has finished.</p>\n</body></html>",
